Sublime Text config
===================

Configs built and tested with Sublime Text 4 (Stable Channel, Build 4107).

Place all the configs from this directory to [the user settings directory of Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/settings.html).
For macOS it's `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime\ Text/Packages/User`.

I use a custom color scheme â€” [Polarise](https://github.com/dymio/polarise_color_scheme).
Install it according to the instruction in the Polarise repository.
Or remove "color_scheme" rule from `Preferences.sublime-settings".
